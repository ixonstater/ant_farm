An open-source mobile/web game for building your own tiny ant farm.
Focuses on user-set parameters, target audience: bored developers.

## Concept

Ants moving around in a pre-defined maze.
Possibility of allowing users to create their own maps via uploaded json files?

## Conceptual Rules / Gameplay

* Place the queen somewhere in the maze.
* Ants spawn at a user set rate.
* Food spawns at a user set rate.
* Ants stop spawning in at a user set ceiling.
* Ants travel and find food, must find enough food to keep ratio above user set value of ants to food to keep the queen alive.
* If an ant doesn't find food within a user set number of turns it dies.
* Ants will pick a random direction from a set of possibilities each turn.
